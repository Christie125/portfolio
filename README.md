This project is my personal website -- a static project that allows a user to learn more about me :)
It has pages talking about my clubs at school, awards, and coding projects, and aims to showcase some of my interests and achievements.

After my mother suggested that I learn Angular (she codes as well), I thought it would be a good idea to create a personal website to have a practical hands-on way to learn -- when it comes to coding, I'm a very learn-by-doing kind of person.
I thought that a personal website would allow be to: a) to have my own place on the Internet, something which is very cool and I can show to random people all over the world; b) have something to show with the skills I learnt, meaning that they would not sit around idle in my brain; and c) would allow me to work in on purely frontend, unlike my other projects, giving me a narrower goal that I could focus on with more precision, resulting in a more high-quality outcome.

I would also be able to put into practise the UX and UI skills I had been practising on Figma (another little hobby of mine -- I like to redesign ugly websites I see on the web). Other knowledge I put into practise was the earlier research I had done on accessibility (skip links etc.) and responisve design (scaling to different screen sizes).

I made this project by doing small steps every day, even if the small step was just formatting a button. Doing this helped me stay motivated, as it did not take a lot of mental energy to work on it. Ultimately, this helped me finish my website in a timely manner and keep me from being burnt out or otherwise discouraged from coding. 

My website also came with a big learning curve since I was learning how to use Angular for the first time (as previously mentioned). 
This meant that is was quite challenging at the beginning to get how everything works. However, I learnt to use online resources efficiently and effectively to find answers to my questions and learn how to do new things, which built up my confindence and accelerated my progress. 

Overall, making my own personal website was a very rewarding and interesting learning experience. I'm very proud of the results!
